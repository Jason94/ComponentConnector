Two types of messages: Data messages and Control messages.

Control messages begin with a 'c' character. Data messages have no special
markers.

Data Messages:
Only used to transmit edge data from the Python nodes to the Scala controller.
Format - "UID1 UID2;UID3 UID4;UID5 UID6; ... ;UIDY UIDZ"
Signifies that there is an edge connecting vertices with UID1 & UID2,
UID3 & UID4, UID5 & UID6, etc. Since the UID's should not contain any spaces
or semicolons, the string should be able to be parsed by using simple splitting.

Control messages:
A particular control message is serialized as "cN", where N is an integer
representing the particular message. This allows the program to easily check
whether a message is a control or data message.
1 - Start listening for edges (Python -> Scala).
2 - Finished current round of edge mapping, begin connected
		component calculation (Python -> Scala).
3 - Connected components have been written to database, begin next round of edge
		calculations (Scala -> Python).
4 - Finished, shutdown (Python -> Scala).
